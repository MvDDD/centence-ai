There are three principles which can lead you to success in writing style meaning and grammar.
Clarity and precision are things that always impress those who read and evaluate your texts and demonstrate your educational and personal qualities.
Grammar and punctuation are vital not only for your academic success but also when you text a date you want to impress correspond for a job interview chat with your colleagues and so on.
There are fourteen punctuation marks used in English grammar you probably know most of them but it does not hurt to repeat them.
They are the period question mark exclamation point comma semicolon colon dash hyphen parentheses brackets braces apostrophe quotation marks and ellipsis.
If you use them correctly your writing will be much easier and appealing to read.
Of course there are certain differences between punctuation in British and American English.
They are not major but they are still important for example in American English such popular abbreviations like Mr Ms and Mrs have periods.
In British however no periods are used when writing the time British English employs periods where noon would be.
In the same case the American system uses colons.
The names of the punctuation marks can also be different.

There are about 1500 of these illustrated Bibles in existence from the time before the printing press.
The oldest New Testament dates from about 200AD and is about the size of a postcard and only contains the chapter where Judas betrays Jesus.
None of the 1500 hand-copied Bibles is identical with any other Bible and even show regional differences, have advertisements and political slogans/appeals in them and one of them ends with the words, “There, I’ve finished copying the damned thing, now can I have a drink?”.
You can find many texts without punctuation from the old days, and poems by ee cummings, for example.
The problem with books today.
In many cases is not that there isn’t enough punctuation, it’s that there is too much.
Many authors who don’t use style guides or have editors end up being too cute.
In the book “Flowers for Algernon” when Charlie Gordon, a mentally challenged man gets an operation that makes him brilliant learns about punctuation, he leaves his teacher a note: “Punctuation, is: ‘fun’!” Punctuation serves to make text more readable and, more importantly, more understandable.
Without it we don’t really know the intention of the writer and it makes reading tedious.
“Let’s eat Grandma” and “Let’s eat, Grandma” are a common funny example of this.
There is even a famous book that talks about this using unintentionally funny headlines like this one about a Koala: “Eats shoots and leaves”.
